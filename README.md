Branch: Forbes

create dir `data` to store cifar/mnist datasets - files are too big to store on github

run training from root dir with `python -m training.train_mnist.py` or `python -m training.train_cifar.py`

To generate feature space visualizations using t-SNE, PCA and UMAP from checkpoints:

run feature_space.py from utils dir with `python -m utils.feature_space`

*Ensure you have run the training files to generate checkpoint shards*
